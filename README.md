## üß† Model Info

The model is trained using the notebook: `ResumeClassifier.ipynb`.  
It uses:

- **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text into numerical features
- **ML classifier** (e.g., Logistic Regression or RandomForest)
- **Custom resume cleaner** with regex and NLTK
- Resume dataset with labeled categories

You can retrain the model by modifying the notebook and re-exporting `clf.pkl` and `tfidf.pkl`.
